QLC+ DMX Re-Patching Utility

QLC+ is an amazing sofware but there are a couple of things that really bug me off. 
One of them is that it's not possible to create virtual master faders (sort of DCAs)
and I can understand that I might not be an easy thing to add. But the other thing is just 
sooooo frustrating that I had to do something about it : the pain that it is to move things around
when you have to repatch a project (just change the addresses, not the fixtures).

How to install:
Just copy the three files (html, css and js) in the same folder on on a webserver and open index.html

How to use:
Click Choose File and select your QLC+ project file (.qxw).
The list of fixtures will appear in a table. You can edit the Universe (0-3) and DMX Address (1-512) for each fixture.
Click the first cell of a row to select/deselect it. You can select multiple rows by dragging with the mouse.
When several rows are selected, changing the DMX address of one will shift all selected fixtures by the same amount.
Click column headers to sort by Name, Universe, DMX Address, or Channels.
Conflicts and out-of-range addresses are highlighted in red. Only valid, non-conflicting patches can be saved.
Click Validate new patch to check for conflicts and download the updated file.
Tip: You can use the Select all (✔) and Unselect all (✖) buttons to quickly select or deselect all fixtures.
